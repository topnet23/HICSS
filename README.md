# Incentives in IoT and IoT Forensics
As more devices become connected and cyberattacks continue to increase, it is crucial to investigate cybersecurity incidents forensically. To utilize the potential of the Internet of Things Forensics (IoTF), incentives can be used to increase motivation. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and identified multiple incentives from 34 publications. Our findings were evaluated by 12 experts and benefit their future work.

This repository contains the documentation of the SLR and evaluation. All files are in CSV format and within the `CSV` folder. We link the corresponding CSV file in the following sections for easy access.
